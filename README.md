# Multi-Source-Transfer-Learning
Normally transfer learning is done at a whole network level or the transfer is upto layer and latter layers are trained suitably.
Whereas in this work we propose a transfer to a target task from multiple CNNs. We consider the granularity of, 1. Network, 2. Layer and 3. Filter level.
Soon we will share the code for the following works:
